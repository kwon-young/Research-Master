## Distributed Computing (DC)

* Birth certificate : Time, clocks and the ordering of events in a distributed
  system, Leslie Lamport, 1978
* DC come when entities solves problem
* each entities have *partial knowledge*
* finding models realistic

* *real-time* : on-time computing
* *parallelism* : efficiency
* *Distributed computing* : uncertainty
  * using a lot of heuristics

Uncertainty

* ...

Models :

* a *model* :
  * collection of attribute
  * set of rule
* a model has to be
  * accurate : has to yield interesting properties
  * tractable : not to precise

Process model

Lamport
> happened before

space-time diagramm
concurrent is not simultaneous, it means it is not causal

* past causal
* future causal
* concurrent

with these, we can precise uncertainty
