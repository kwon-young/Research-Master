# Introduction

* What is OMR [see @fornes2014analysis and @rebelo2012optical]
    * hybrid field 
        * structured document recognition
        * image recognition
    * multiple phase
        * pretreatment
        * staff removal
        * symbol segmentation
        * symbol recognition
        * semantic reconstruction
* dmos system [see @couasnon2001dmos]
    * general purpose document recognition
    * grammar
    * parser
* music symbol segmentation and recognition
    * merging the two phase
        * pro
        * cons
    * different techniques used
        * markov chains
    * use of deep learning techniques
        * in OCR with lstm networks
        * in object recognition with convolutional
