# Recurrent Models of Visual Attention

## Abstract

Convolutional network computationally expansive on big image.
New RNN Model for adaptively select ROI and process ROI at high definition.
Translation invariance property built-in.
Amount of computation can be controlled.
Non differentiable model (so no supervised techniques ?).
Reinforcement learning methods : learn task-specific policies.
Outperform convolutional model.
