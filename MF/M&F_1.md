# Models and Formalisms

How to solve a problem

Bergson, XXth :
> A problem well stated is on its way to solution

* What does *stated* means ?
* What is a well stated problem ?
* then solving it ...
  * we naturally use math as a tool to resolve problem
  * we can use other tools to solve problem

A big picture

* we use our *brain*
* System under study (SuS)
* The model : production, linkage to :
  * brain
  * the SuS
  It is outside of our brain, can be communicated

Semantic triangle :
* Thought of reference / idea
* Referent             / thing
* Symbol               / word
* can be used to represent abstract things

Reflection on reflection :
* Tools to state a problem :
  * language
  * math
  * programs
  * media : audio, writing, ...
* How do we state problems ?
  * common aspects of all process
  * To identify, select, describe ...

Identifying

* Recognize, invent :
  * previous identical experiences
  * previous close experineces
* Similarities, metaphors, links, comparisons
* Exact, approximate, compleemnt
* identify what is important

Naming

John the Apostle, Ist
> In the beginning was the Word

* Importance of choosing right names
  * ambiguities, vagueness
  * method overriding/overloading
  * verification :internal to the system / validation : external to the system

Two way to describe a train :
* Implicit vs Explicit : is train explicitly *reified*

Selecting

* Among identifying :
  * all ?
  * useful one ? (actual problm for informatitian)
* *Ockham's razor* :
  > Entities must not be multiplied beyond necessity.
  > Plurality should not be posited without necessity.
  From William of Ockham, XIVth
  Is God part of every explication
Time is needed to construct a model.
a model needs to search, purify, improve a model
This is science

Describing/Represnting

* Transmit (in time, to others, especially to oneself) : time is important
* Risk with interpretation :
  * language is complex, not precise
  * incomprehension
  * Misunderstanding, but can lead to innovation

Making mistakes

* innovation factors
  * Noise
  * defaults
  * mistakes

James Joyce XXth
> Errare humanum est
> Mistakes are the portals of discovery

Cicero -Ist
> Any man can make mistakes, but only an idiot persists in his error

example : neural network

Remarks :
* Our ability come from our toolbox
* toolbox come from our predecessor

But :

* Prison from past authorities
  * challenge
  * criticize
  * take the risk of being wrong
  * example : euler theorem, implicit hypothesis

Searcher are hunter of implicit

Describing :
* Sounds : Philosophy
  * problems : there is no prouf or trace, sophisms
* Writings : philosophy
  * problems : sophism
* Graphical
* Math
  * hidden hypothesis
* Computers
  * 4 color theorem
    * brute force
    * coq : authomated prove

> Proof is a social process of trust

Sophism

* Argumentum ad hominem (personal)
* Argumentum ad verecundiam (authority)
* Argumentum ad consequentiam (consequences)
* Argumentum ad novitatem (newer)
* ...

Goals

* Different ways of modeling
* process to solve problems
* if tools are different but intellectual approach are similar

Process of modelisation

* Identify concepts
* Class, group, link, categorize
* Identify rules/constrains
* Transformation, proof, deduction â€¦ : tools
* this is not simple, it is not linear, it's iterative, looped

What is a Model

* SuS : this hold the truth
* formal world : syntax, calculus, what is provable
* model is interaction between these two concepts
* If everything proved is true, the formal model is said consistent
  * example : different kind of geometry
  * this is validation
* if everything true is provable : the formal model is said complete

Godel Incompleteness Theorem
arithmetic system connot be complete and consistent

Verification and Validation

* Verification : internal checking
* Validation : external checking

Research

* search the good model

> Predicting is not understanding

Formal modeling

* based on math formallism
* rigorous
* old, well-known and powerful tool
* reasoning/deduction
* difficult access
* abstract : language level, being closer to reality, validation
* abstraction : hide details, focus on important things, okhab razor

Modeling (UML)

* Graphical notation
* simple access
* vague semantics (semantics variation points)
  * example : association, aggregation, state chart, redefinition, overload
* modelisation is to give meaning, make semantics choices

Language

* computer language : universal tools
* DSL : Domain Specific Language : dedicated tools
  * UML profile = modeling DSL
  * profile = set of concepts defined by stereotypes <<>>
  * specialisation of UML to specific domain

And then

* Mix everything

Goals

* Convince choose good tools is important
* process to construct the model is important

Master complexity by models
* models needs to hide unnecessary details
* models needs to make choice
* but models needs to says pertinant things
* find the good balance

we can model :

* the world, already existing world
  * judge is the world
  * robust
* a system to build
  * important to says what we need explicitly

Modeling

* metamodel is the rules on how to make a model
* metamodel is not a model of a model
* a model is not an instance of a metamodel
* for programing langugage, metamodel is syntax of the language

Intent of the model

* answer questions
* verify properties
* with limites

Megamodeling

* we empile level of grammar
* MOF -> Syntax UML -> UML

Modeling languages

* Math
  * add of symbol that can be themself a math object
  * Abstraction : reification
* Maps, picture
* Simulations

Mechanisms that help thinking

* Modeling : make the good choice

UML architecture

* Instance
* Class
* metamodel uml
* meta-metamodel, metaclass in MOF

## conclusion

* Natural language
  * ambiguities
  * under-specification
  * redundancy
  * noise
  * contradiction
* Formal language
  * 3 level of correctness
    * syntax corectness
    * transformation
    * intention
      * not provable
      * consensus
