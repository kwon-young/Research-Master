## Abstract

Challenge of the article :

* multi-functionality
* metastability
* switching

Investigating collective phase relationship among brain oscillation in neurophysiological data.

Main obstacle is *volume conduction of electrical fields*.

Volume conduction

:   term of bioelectromagnetism
    transmission of electric or magnetic fields from an electric primary current source through biological tissue toward measurement sensors.

## Introduction

### Understanding complexity : the theoretical framework of coordination dynamics

Brain is multi-level connected system and this architecture allows to express complexity and self-organization.

Understanding the brain is :

* understanding each part of the brain
* understanding coordination between parts of the brain
* understanding coupling between brain and the world

theoretical framework of coordination dynamics seek to explain :

* perception
* cognition
* consciousness
* behavior

What have been achieved by dynamic coordination :

* identify complex coordination patterns
* express formally coordination patterns

### assessing coupled cortical areas : whole brain approaches

Understanding coordination of parts of the brain by using EEG and MEG.
Post process on raw signal is necessary to extract patterns.
Patterns identified with theoretical framework :

* stationary coupling between brain oscillations
* transient patterns of phase synchrony = metastability
* abrupt phase transitions between cortical patterns

Theoretical framework avoid misinterpretation of measurement.

## Generalized model of brain coordination dynamics

### Collective behavior: multistability, phase transitions and metastability

This theoretical model is based on empirical studies.
Model of the brain is about coupling oscillators.
Generate cortex interactions with different system parameters:

* multistable state
    * strong coordination of all brain areas
    * no local coordination
* metastability
    * coordination of local areas
    * relative interaction of brain areas
    * expression of both integrative activity and local autonomous activity
    * robust, speed, flexibility, versatility : adaptive cortical system
* state transitions
* instability

### Spontaneous oscillations and transient coordination

source of oscillation are appear regularly in time.
band-pass filter to extract specific oscillation.

colorimetric method : 

better selection and representation of high dimensional data : x, y represented with color, time, amplitude represented by axes.

## Apparent phase-locking in continuous EEG

study of phase-locking.

inphase-locking commonly found in litterature.

new approach with the study of antiphase and near inphase and near antiphase

### Inphase-locking

EEG shows a lot of inphase-locking. induced lot of studies on it.
volume conduction induce false inphase-locking.

phase detection depends on strength and orientation of active source.
propagation of fields depends on the structure of the brain.

multiple source strengthen each others.
certain configurations of inphase-locking imply confirmation of real synchrony.

### Antiphase-locking

little studies on antiphase-locking.
sensitive to system parameter.
again volume conduction problem.
multiple source cancel each others.

### locking at other phases.

cannot be explained by volume conduction.
scarce and brief.
can constitute valid estimates of true phase-locking in the brain.

## Effect of spatial correlation : phase-locked states

forward simulation of two source.

### Biases in scalp amplitude

when relative phase of source are in inphase state, amplitude is enhanced.
in antiphase state, amplitude is reduced.
induce consequences on how to observe the brain.

### Biases in scalp relative phase

phase-locked pattern at the scalp appear closer to inphase that they actually are.
antiphase is an exception, with major amplitude loss.

overestimation of zero-lag synchronization.

## Effect of spatial correlation : transition and metastability

transition : oscillations dephase and return to their original frequencies.

drift of relative phases.

in metastable state, cycle of transition is observed.
dependency of brain areas weakens and strenghtens intermittently.
evidence of coordination.

### Dynamic biases and spurious synchrony

During transitions, amplitude and phase are also biased dynamically with previous features and also affects frequencies

lots of configuration where apparent synchrony is not a real synchrony.

### Implications

knowledge of biases used to detect false synchrony.

consequences

* scalp amplitude is not a direct manifestation of signal source amplitude.
* apparent correlation may be seen at the scalp level when source are decoupling.
* inflation of zero-lag synchronisation

continuous EEG analysis through colorimetric methods can dwell with these biases.

## Identifying genuine coordination

4D colorimetric mapping permit

* to show instantaneous episode of phase-locking between multiple brain areas
* to show unambiguous identification of the transitory stable and metastable neural assemblies

guidelines to identify true inter-areal coordination in spatiotemporal patterns

* other phase-locked state than inphase or antiphase is a safe instance of phase-locking.
parameters of phase-locking may be distorted.
* inphase-locked state confirmed with special conditions (don't know what condition)
difficult to find real relative phase of the source
* antiphase state is difficult to determine because of low amplitude.

## Conclusion

60 years of history of the theory of transiently synchronized neural cell assemblies.
framework used to establish empirical test of brain coordination dynamics.
model can predict :

* which area will be coupled
* frequencies and phase relationships among coupled brain areas

Main obstacle of interpreting EEG and MEG is volume conduction.
model help to recognize false and true pattern.

inphase-locking is not the only important thing.
other phase-locking pattern may be important.
-> bistability using inphase and antiphase.

state that increases the exchange of information between part of the brain is not the only best way to exhibit behaviour.
multistable state and metastable state is also a way of encoding and communicate information.

> brain coordination dynamics thus lies at the intersection of where neuroscience meet complexity
