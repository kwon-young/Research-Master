# An introduction to Cognitive Sciences (CS)

Definition for CS :

* Human knowledge
* propre à l'esprit
* how does human function, feels, decide, have emotion
* stereotype : 
  * intellectual cognition: high level cognition, example : abstraction, math. doable nowaday by computer
* savoir-faire : playing piano, not doable by computer
* writing : externalize his memory, free the brain, the mind vs tools that free the body
* incarnated cognition, enfance, our environment form us.

from the book :

* Philosophy : applied to CS, analytic philosophy, phénoménologie
* psychology : diff with philosophy does experiences, experimentation, cognitive psychology
  * make them think there doing experiment A, but they are doing experiment B
* computer sciences : theoric, research, vs software engineering
  * algorithmic principle
* linguistic : principal way to reason, communicate
* anthropology : technic, tools, human development with technic
* neurosciences : we see thoughts

Homework :

* group of 2/3 students
* choosing a domain
* choosing an article
* make a short presentation

* dissertation

classical unresolvable questions

* math and CS is difficult to apprehend the basis
* pluridisciplinaire
* what difference between human and animals ?
  * in our modern time, we see more resemblance between human and animals
  * evolution
* can we function how the brain work ?
  * the brain is a machinery
  * what is the global program
* can we understand ourselves, our own functionning ?
  * recursivity
  * hierarchical knowledge
* how can we recognize a shape or a music ?
  * human genius, autiste
  * pi is a melodie
  * different memory
* is the body important ?
  * what is the world for a blind ?
* is the environment more important than the brain ?
  * brain in a vasque
  * matrix, the film
* what is the consciousness, is it in the brain ?
* does colors exist objectively ?
  * consensus social
* what is the link between objective and subjective view ?
  * if Intelligence is propre à l'humain, IA can't exist

This course

* is an introduction
* is about SC and Cognitive Psychology
  * psychology contains science
* neuroscience

Before cognitive sciences

* behaviorism in opposition to philosophy
  * philosoph is the one to ask question : multi-domain
  * explosion of every domain
* default of philo :
  * introspection
  * but no experience to validate knowledge
  * can't be objective
  * psychology against philo :
    * make experience
    * validate or not a hypothesis
    * attempt to be objective
* representation are rejected by psycholog
  * brain is a black box
* behaviorism
  * treat human like phyiscs
  * send stimulus to animals
  * watch response = behavior

* behaviorists : 
  * pavlov : dog experiment
  * attention : psychology cognitive is different to clinic psychology
  * tolman : rat experiment : proof of memory, cognitive map
  * skinner : pigeon experiment
  * importance of statistics

cognitive psychology :

* follow behaviorism
* image a model of functionment of the brain
* experimentation
* models : paradigme de mahr for vision
* epistemological postulat : there is always big hypothesis before every questions
* those postulat can be discuted

Main field in cognitive psychology

* chomsky : star, engaged politkly, nativism
* hypothesis : 
  * there are structures in human mind that are universal
  * generic language to learn language
  * study of langage
  * formal meta-model to generate language
  * grammar generative

* piaget : constructivism
* importance of action : importance of perception-action, non reversible development of the brain
  * assimilation
  * accomodation
  * equilibration
* abstraction
* sensorimotor

* ecological field
  * social (vygotski 1934)
    * group work, auto stimulus
  * physic
    * shape theorie
    * affordance

* gestalttheorie
  * use of image illusion
  * from little element, we can reconstruct everything : reccurent neural network
* affordance
  * form of an object link to the action needed
  * design
