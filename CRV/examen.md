# Designing Modular Architectures in the Framework AKIRA

## Abstract

AKIRA : open source framework for parallel, asynchronous and distributed computation.
Modular organization inspired from biological systems.

## Introduction

AKIRA used for designing and managing *modules*.

Biological systems properties :

* self-organization
* adaptivity
* robustness

models using AKIRA shows :

* self-organizations
* competition
* cooperation among modules
* emergence
* adaptivity

AKIRA used to design *modular systems*.
Architectural level : how modules interact.

AKIRA features :

* distribution
* parallelism
* asynchrony
* decentralization of control
* support for forming hierarchies : for emergent effects

server client like architecture.
connectionist features :

* variable activation level.
    * set computational resources
* energy computed by connectionist network
* energy define priority

*Energy Pool*.

modules as basic elements. circular causality.

Distribution and parallelism

:   Modules run on differents thread of execution; they can also be distributed in a client-server architecture involving many running instances of AKIRA

Asynchrony

:   modules run asynchronously and with different priorities. Their messaging is performed in that way, since all active modules can read and write asynchronously from the blackboard.

Decentralized of control

:   many functions are realized in decentralized way.

* bio-inspired techniques
    * functioning of complex systems
          * many complex systems, operate and interact
          * produce behavior
    * inspiration from Society of Mind, Pandemonium
    * many narrow-minded specialists (modules)
    * fulfill common goals through selfish behavior
    * share resources : self organization, cooperation, competition
    * modules should always be very simple
* cognitive architectures
    * modules can be partially or totally active
    * ACT-R has horizontal modularity
        * modules are limited to peripheral tasks
    * in AKIRA : semi-independent, concurrent behavioral components with dynamic interaction
        * vertical modularity
    * narrow-minded, specialized agent interact and compete in same env.
    * cooperation and coordination are emergent properties
    * no selection mechanism
* MAS
    * distribution, synchronization and coordination principle issue
    * four kind of MAS architecture :
        * centralized auctions (centralized and synchronous)
        * hierarchical auctions (distributed and synchronous)
        * centralized leaky bucket (centralized and asynchronous)
        * mobile brokers (distributed and asynchronous)
    * coordination
        * explicitly exchange information : Contract Net Protocol
        * environment-based coordination : *stigmergy*
        * use of a blackboard
    * agents are independent, modules are not
    * agents are composed of modules

## Organization of the Modular Systems

Modules are Swiss Army Knife, plethora of specialized resources.

To make an integrated system :

* use of a central module for selecting best modules for the goal
* use of cooperation of modules

inspired from biological systems.

modules are embedded in a living organism, consume resources, facilitate or inhibit each other, learn, grow, etc.
Their peculiar organization make them able to produce complex tasks.

Exchanging Resources :

* resources
    * priority, activation, communication bandwidth, access to sensors and effectors, representation space
* systemic features
    * hierarchical organization, cooperation, exploitation, context awareness

* local (short range) excitation : positive feedback
    * self-enhancing effects
* global (long range) inhibition : negative feedback
* self-regulating and self-sustaining processes and patterns
* appear when component exchange resources and info while obeying to specific rules, positive and negative feedback
* local resources exchange can create global emergent behavior
    * alternative way to conceive "arbitration", without a central controller
* *internal control parameters* or *order parameters*

Exchanging Information

insects exchange info with signals or cues.
Complex forms of organization generated by learning to exploit and give meaning to signals and cues.

Environment is important for exchanging resources and informations.
In stigmergy, the environment acts as a medium.
Robust pattern of interaction.

four design principles for selection and collaboration :

* Acquisition and Transfer of Resources
    * positive feedback of receiving or transmitting resources
    * influence other's computation through energy network
* Competition for Limited Resources
    * consumption of limited resources : *Energy Pool*
    * negative feedback
* Introspection
    * modules can see each other output
    * modules can see each other activity levels
    * used for forming hierarchy, meta management
* Synchronization
    * use env as an external medium
        * modules interact without explicit comunicating
    * stigmergy
