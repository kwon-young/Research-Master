# Multi-agent systems

Autonomous behavior :

* perception
* decision
* action

Pro-Active

Interaction

* between agents
* between agent and env

Rational behavior

* local perception and action
* limited repertoire of actions
* bounded rationality
* Finite amount of time and computational resources to decide


env -> Perception <-> Decision process <-> Action -> env
                              ^

                            Goals

## MAS as Systems

MAS

* adaptation to the system
* self properties and org
* emerging properties
* "Distributed Artificial Intelligence"

Agent

:   * Physical or logical, autonomous & proactive entities
    * interacting wiht env and other agents

MAS

:   self-organized set of agents immersed into an env and acting together to reach a common goal
    Adaptative, self organized, emergence

MABS approach

* cellular automata
* Individual-based approach
* Population-based modeling

MABS application : complex systems

MAS benefits : autonomy, adaptivity, coordination

Issue and challenge

* reactivity vs pro-activity
* autonomy vs collaboration
* context-specific behavior with general-purpose agent
* planing, anticipation within a dynamic environment
* action selection, continuous planing
* distributed control, distributed intelligence
* behavioral stability & plasticity
* efficient collaboration
* emergence
* verification & validation

## Design of MAS

### Agent

Nature, behavior, learning

### Environment

Space with properties.

### Interaction

Influence & reactions.
Perception & actions.
Communication inter agents and agent & env.

### Organization

tool or process(emergence)

### User

role, in or out, immersed use

Architecture list

* reactive
* cognitive
* embodied conversational agent
* recursive

## Communication

Characteristics

* intention
* contents
* freedom to listen
* interpretation
* direct, mediated
* law for traveling

Protocols

* heterogeneous MAS
* agent's autonomy
* level of interoperability
* rules
* issue
    * robustness / heterogeneity & autonomy
    * flexibility / message ordering & handling
    * logical consistency

Speech act theory

Agent Communication Language.
FIPA : IEEE standard

Model of communication protocols : $\pi$ calculus.

## Contract Net Protocol

* distributed resolution problem by task splitting
* no big brother
* communication : broadcast + point to point

FIPA CNP

### Scenario

* manager
    * wants to solve a problem
    * makes tender
* contractors
    * makes bid on tender received
* manager
    * choose best bid
    * make a contract with bidder
* contractors work

### task announcement

* task abstraction
* eligibility abstraction
* bid specification
